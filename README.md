# Ray-Tracing-Algorithm
This project implements a hybrid CUDA–Verilog ray tracing system to render reflective scenes with primary, reflection, and shadow rays. It features custom IEEE-754 floating-point units and a finite state machine–based ray tracing core, integrated with CUDA scene management to generate final rendered images.
